# **Avengers Authentication System**

This Android application provides a unique login experience for both privileged and unprivileged Avengers. Privileged Avengers access the app with specific passwords and see their superhero names displayed in the title bar. Unprivileged Avengers use a general password and a shared mobile number to log in.

Example: Entering password "tony" displays the title **Iron Man**.


**Unprivileged Login Access:** Other Avengers log in using a general password "thanos" and a shared mobile number. Upon successful login, the title **The Avengers** appears in the title bar.

**Button Functionalities:**

**Login Button:** Verifies the userâ€™s credentials and displays the appropriate title based on access level.
